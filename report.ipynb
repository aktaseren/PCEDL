    "## Introduction\n",
    "**Deep learning** (DL) is a subset of techniques in the machine learning/AI field that attempts to learn patterns from data using algorithms that are not task-specific (generic). The algorithms are usually based on artificial neural networks made of several hidden layers, hence the word \"deep\", with also a large number of neurons<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>. The deeper the network, the higher the model complexity together with its level of abstraction capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the data scientists had to use statistical techniques and expertise in order to obtain the hand-crafted features, but DL is able to identify and learn the features on its own during the training phase. The approach has been successfully applied to classification tasks in the field of computer vision and voice recognition but it can also be applied to regression tasks such as prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to **experiment and learn** how to apply the Deep Learning methods for **predicting the power generated by a wind turbine using its power curve data**. For those outside the wind industry, power curves represent the relationship between the electricity generated by the wind turbine and the wind speed at a given time<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup>. Besides _predicting the production of wind power_, power curves are also used for _monitoring the production efficiency_ of the wind turbines. \n",
    "\n",
    "To challenge the Deep Learning approach, a state-of-the-art reference model was used. In 2015, Lee et al. presented an additive multivariate kernel (AMK) method for power curve estimation<sup>[3](#ref3)</sup>. They did not only write an excellent article but also they make the results reproducible by published the dataset used together with the algorithm in an R package called _kerplus_<sup>[4](#ref4)</sup>. This provided a valueable baseline for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the document is structured as follows. First, the datasets used for training the models are presented together with some visualizations. Second part contains the details about the Neural Network architecture, the hyperparameters selection and the results obtained. The last part contains a brief discussion and the comparison between the DL approach with the paper.    "

    "High quality public available datasets about wind turbine power curves are extremely rare. My sincere gratitude to Lee et al. for sharing the J53 dataset on Internet. The data is made of 1 year of 10 minute records from 6 Wind Turbines (4 onshore and 2 offshore). For the present analysis 2 subsets are going to be used. One is the subset contained in the the R package called _windpw_<sup>[4](#ref4)</sup>. The second subset is all datapoint that belongs to the Wind Turbine 1 (WT1).\n",

    "Nevertheless, actual wind power data indicate that the power output is affected by more than just wind speed. Several other environmental factors, such as wind direction, air density, humidity, turbulence intensity, and wind shears, have potential impact. Yet, in industry practice, as well as in the literature, current power curve models primarily consider wind speed and, sometimes, wind speed and direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose an additive multivariate kernel method that can include the aforementioned environmental factors as a new power curve model. Our model provides, conditional on a given environmental condition, both the point estimation and density estimation of power output. It is able to capture the nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and the wind power output, as well as the high-order interaction effects among some of the environmental factors. Using operational data associated with four turbines in an inland wind farm and two turbines in an offshore wind farm, we demonstrate the improvement achieved by our kernel method.\n"
